Sometimes they are served Parmesan style, with tomato sauce and mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Breaded cutlets (schnitzels, cotoletta, or escalope may have first appeared on the wider European culinary scene with the Napoleonic armies for conservation purposes. Napoleon offered a monetary reward to the person who developed a method to transport conserved food for a longer amount of time that then could be consumed unspoiled. Although the breading of meat concept was not the winner, it was a culinary development that was quickly adopted in northern Italy. The original Viennese schnitzel of breaded veal, pork, or chicken which originated in various forms beginning around the 17th century, was adapted to a roll sandwich in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (served with mayonnaise or mustard and lettuce). It did not transfer to American cuisine as its Italian relative did, but remains popular today throughout Central Europe."
